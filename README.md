# Template

This is all coded from my android, using termux and the serverless framework

I needed a sink where I can send some events too with very little cost. I also needed to do some processing on those events.

Everything is saved in a mongodb and will be later used for some analytics

I have prepared a websocket integration for pushing things realtime later on an android flutter app...

( This is for no good purpose but for all useless glory :D )
